I have three reasons to start this blog.

* to improve my English
* to keep records of my daily life
* to use Gatsby and Netlify

## To improve my English

It has already been one year since I moved to Toronto. Time flies! At the same time, I feel my English didn't improve enough.... I saw and heard a lot of Japanese who studied abroad for only one year speaking English fluently. Compared with them, my English is less that I expected.

I was inspired by Yamamoto Azusa san's Daily English & Japanese in voicy I started listening recently. She talks her daily topics in English and Japanese. Surprisingly, she speaks in English first and in Japanese later without script. I decided to try the same thing in blog.

トロントに住んで一年が経ちますが、自分の英語はまだまだと思っています。1年留学しただけでもペラペラになる人もたくさんいるのに、私の英語は1年前に自分が思っていたのより全然レベルが低いです。

どうしようかと思っているときに、voicyで山本あずささんのDaily English & Japaneseを見つけました。彼女は日々の出来事を英語と日本語で話しています。しかもスクリプトなしに英語でまず話し、そのあと日本語で話すのです。これはいい方法だと思い、自分もブログで試してみることにしました。

## To keep records of my daily life

Everyone has different experience and knowledge. A lot of blogs always help me make a decision. I hope that my blog helps someone as well as I'm motivated to do new things by being seen by someone.

While this is going to be a big change for professional coffee tasters, it means a lot to you as a consumer as well. We’ll explain how the wheel came to be, how pros use it and what the flavors actually mean.

## What the updates mean to you

The Specialty Coffee Association of America (SCAA), founded in 1982, is a non-profit trade organization for the specialty coffee industry. With members located in more than 40 countries, SCAA represents every segment of the specialty coffee industry, including:

Coffee cupping, or coffee tasting, is the practice of observing the tastes and aromas of brewed coffee. It is a professional practice but can be done informally by anyone or by professionals known as "Q Graders". A standard coffee cupping procedure involves deeply sniffing the coffee, then loudly slurping the coffee so it spreads to the back of the tongue.

The coffee taster attempts to measure aspects of the coffee's taste, specifically the body (the texture or mouthfeel, such as oiliness), sweetness, acidity (a sharp and tangy feeling, like when biting into an orange), flavour (the characters in the cup), and aftertaste. Since coffee beans embody telltale flavours from the region where they were grown, cuppers may attempt to identify the coffee's origin.
