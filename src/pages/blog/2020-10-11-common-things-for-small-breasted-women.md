  I have felt inferior about my breasts for a long time because they are small.
  Some women may feel in the same way and empathize with my experience.
  私は長年、貧乳であることにコンプレックスがあります。おそらく同じように感じて私の体験に共感できる女性もいるのではないでしょうか。

These are the facts of small breast women.

* When I was a teenager, my boyfriend and his friends made fun of me about my small breast.
* When I buy a swimsuit, store clerks always recommend thick pads. 
* Nobody pays attention to my breasts, even during sex.
* I dream about breast cleavage, but what is there are only bones. 
* I like the success stories of small breast women.
* I cannot help gazing at the big breasts of other women.
* The majority of guys have had sex with bigger breast women, which takes away my sexual confidence.
* I have searched the way to make my breast bigger for many times, but all of them didn't work. 
* I feel I studied too hard in puberty.

However, I'm trying to look at the bright side.

* I assume I have a fast metabolism. 
* Less hook up unless you want.
* If I had bigger breasts, I wouldn't meet my current boyfriend. 
* Small bras are handy.
* I don't have any female enemies.
* I'm not worried about breasts sagging.
* I have never felt leering eyes from random guys.

But after all, I wish I had bigger breasts at least normal-sized breasts. 

What I can do is to divert my attention to other stuff like workout and studying.
